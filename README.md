# Ultrasonic-Radar-and-Detection-System
**Abstract**—This report goes over the design and functionality of
 an Ultrasonic Radar and Detection System. This system is capable
 of detecting objects within it’s range of view using an ultrasonic
 sensor mounted on a stepper motor. The sensor is continuously
 scanning it’s surrounding area, displaying in real time on an LCD
 screen. When an object is detected, the corresponding location
 on the LCD screen will light up. There will also be a buzzer that
 goes off at certain frequencies, based on the objects distance.
 This project is intended to be used in real time scenarios/fields
 such as in security, automated monitoring, and detection.
